In particular, it contains the reproducible code for the experiment and final thesis, as well as the raw data. 

## Experiment

This is the html/js-implementation of the experiment. In particular,

- the canvas for drawing predictions
- the wrapper to collect data
- the final prediction task

Francisco is working on a newer version of the experiment which should be available soon.


## Data

This contains the collected data of our experiments:

- Raw data of participants
- Use data for forecasts
- Scripts to analyze participants

Note: This is still work in progress and we will amend continuously.


## Thesis

Francisco will add his thesis here once it's done. Currently, it only contains the proposal.
