  NOT YET APPROVED:
  a002 -- minimum effort in Stage 1
  a007 -- looks like no effort but maybe yes?
  a015 -- definitely no effort
  a038 -- did not understand the plot?
  a018 -- VERY linear in stage 1

  a106 -- REALLY strange. Instructions not understood? <-- remove
  a021 -- Very strange patterns  <-- remove (density guy)
  a022 -- VERY linear in stage 1
  a019 -- did the person understand the graph?
  a118 -- One of the plots I had trouble removing a plot point
                              that I added accidently, so I just finished the plot
                              and did the others. The plot that I had trouble with
                              was sales forecast for large company - part 2. You
                              can see some points I added accidently in year 3,
                              and when I couldn't remove them, I just added one plot
                              point at the end of year 4 and hit continue to do the others.
                              Sorry about this. <-- remove trial
